I couldn't retrieve the contents of the repository directly, but I can help you craft a README tailored to a typical **event-driven ingestor** in Go that uses filesystem notifications (fsnotify) and builds via Docker with the specified command. Please feel free to adjust the descriptions, commands, or details to closely match the actual repository structure and purpose.

# `simple-event-driven-ingestor`

A lightweight, Go-based, event-driven ingestor that watches file system changes and processes events in response, powered by [`fsnotify`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) for cross-platform file system notifications ([Go Packages][1]).

## Features

* Monitors specified directories or files for events such as creation, modification, renaming, or deletion.
* Triggers user-defined handlers for reactive processing.
* Built with simplicity and portability in mind.
* Containerized via Docker for easy deployment and consistency across environments.

---

## Prerequisites

* Go 1.17 or newer
* Docker and Docker CLI
* Compatible OS for `fsnotify` (Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD, illumos) ([Go Packages][1])

---

## Installation / Building via Docker

Use the following command to build the project:

```bash
docker build -t go-wal-fsnotify .
```

This creates a Docker image named `go-wal-fsnotify`.

### Running the Container

Once built:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/watch:/watched go-wal-fsnotify
```

* `-v /path/to/watch:/watched`: Mounts a host directory into the container for monitoring.
* `--rm`: Automatically removes the container once it stops.

Adjust volume mounts and flags as needed.
